; LED Panels Schedule File (lynx.sch)
;
; This file defines the competition event schedule for keyboard navigation.
; When this file exists and contains valid entries, Page Up/Page Down keys will
; navigate through events in the order listed here (instead of just incrementing
; heat numbers).
;
; FORMAT:
;   - Lines starting with semicolon (;) are comments and are ignored
;   - Each data line contains: event,round,heat
;   - No header row is required
;   - Events are processed in the order they appear in this file
;
; NAVIGATION BEHAVIOR:
;   - Page Up moves to the next event in the schedule
;   - Page Down moves to the previous event (but cannot go before the starting event)
;   - Home resets to the starting event
;   - Starting event is determined from config/current_event.json when the program starts
;   - If the current event is not in the schedule, the closest scheduled event at or
;     after the current position will be used as the starting point
;   - Navigation is forward-only from the starting position (cannot go to events
;     that occurred before the program started)
;
; EXAMPLE ENTRIES:
;   3,1,1     ; Event 3, Round 1, Heat 1
;   1,1,1     ; Event 1, Round 1, Heat 1
;   7,1,1     ; Event 7, Round 1, Heat 1
;   7,1,2     ; Event 7, Round 1, Heat 2
;   7,1,3     ; Event 7, Round 1, Heat 3
;
; VALIDATION:
;   - Only entries that exist in lynx.evt will be included in the schedule
;   - Invalid entries are logged and skipped
;   - If no valid entries remain after validation, the program falls back to
;     simple heat increment mode (original behavior)
;
; FILE MONITORING:
;   - This file is monitored for changes during program execution
;   - When the file is modified, the schedule is reloaded automatically
;   - The starting position is recalculated based on the current event
;   - If the file is deleted, the program switches to heat increment mode
;
; NOTES:
;   - This file is meet-specific and should not be committed to version control
;   - Copy this file to config/lynx.sch and customize for your competition
;   - The schedule determines the order of events, not just which events to include
;   - Multiple heats of the same event/round can be listed in any order
